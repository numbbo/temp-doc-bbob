<div id="text-f11">

$$f_{11}(\mathbf{x}) = 10^6 z_1^2 + \sum_{i = 2}^{D} z_i^2 + f_\mathrm{opt}$$

-   $\mathbf{z}= T_\mathrm{\hspace*{-0.01emosz}}(\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{x}- \mathbf{x^\mathrm{opt}}))$

**Properties:**

Globally quadratic function with local irregularities. A single
direction in search space is a thousand times more sensitive than all
others.

-   conditioning is about $10^6$

**Information gained from this function:**

-   In comparison to f<sub>1</sub>: What is the effect of constraint-like
    penalization?
