direction in search space is a thousand times more sensitive than all
others.

-   conditioning is about $10^6$

**Information gained from this function:**

## Python Usage Examples

To limit benchmarking experiments only to the first ten instances of this problem from 2009 in dimensions 
2 and 20, instantiate the `Suite` as follows:

```{python}
import cocoex

suite = cocoex.Suite(
  suite_name="bbob", 
  suite_instance="year: 2009", 
  suite_options="function_indices: 11 instance_indices: 1-10 dimensions: 2,20"
)
problem = suite[0]
print(problem.info)  
```

Sometimes it can be useful to access a `bbob` problem without using it in a benchmarking experiment. For such needs, the problem can be instantiated for any instance number and dimension using the `BareProblem`
interface. Note that the bare problem *cannot be observed/logged*. 

```{python}
import cocoex

problem = cocoex.BareProblem(
  suite_name="bbob", 
  function=11, 
  dimension=14, 
  instance=42
)
problem(14 * [0])
```

## C Implementation
