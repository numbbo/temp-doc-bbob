$$f_{22}(\mathbf{x}) = T_\mathrm{\hspace*{-0.01emosz}}\left( 10 - \max_{i=1}^{21} 
       w_i \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2D}\, 
           (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}_i)^{\mathrm{T}}\mathbf{R}^{\mathrm{T}}
           \mathbf{C}_i \mathbf{R}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}_i) \right) \right)^2 + f_{\mathrm{pen}}(\mathbf{x}) + f_\mathrm{opt}$$

-   $w_i = \begin{cases}
                  1.1 + 8 \times\dfrac{i-2}{19} & \text{for~} i=2,\dots,21 \\
    	      10 & \text{for~} i = 1 
    	      \end{cases}$, two optima have a value larger than $9$

-   $\mathbf{C}_i=\Lambda^{\!\alpha_i}/\alpha_i^{1/4}$
    where $\Lambda^{\!\alpha_i}$ is defined as usual (see [Symbols and definitions](#symbols-and-definitions)), 
-   but with randomly permuted diagonal
    elements. For $i=2,\dots,21$, $\alpha_i$ is drawn uniformly randomly
    from the set $\left\{1000^{2\frac{j}{19}} ~|~ j =
      0,\dots,19\right\}$ without replacement, and $\alpha_i=1000^2$ for
    $i=1$.

-   the local optima $\mathbf{y}_i$ are uniformly drawn
    from the domain $[-4.9,4.9]^D$ for $i=2,\dots,21$ and
    $\mathbf{y}_{1}\in [-3.92,3.92]^D$. The global optimum is at
    $\mathbf{x^\mathrm{opt}}=\mathbf{y}_1$.

**Properties:**

The function consists of $21$ optima with position and height being
unrelated and randomly chosen (different for each instantiation of the
function), based on [@gallagher2006general].

-   the conditioning around the global optimum is about $1000$

**Information gained from this function:**

## Python Usage Examples

To limit benchmarking experiments only to the first ten instances of this problem from 2009 in dimensions 
2 and 20, instantiate the `Suite` as follows:

```{python}
import cocoex

suite = cocoex.Suite(
  suite_name="bbob", 
  suite_instance="year: 2009", 
  suite_options="function_indices: 22 instance_indices: 1-10 dimensions: 2,20"
)
problem = suite[0]
print(problem.info)  
```

Sometimes it can be useful to access a `bbob` problem without using it in a benchmarking experiment. For such needs, the problem can be instantiated for any instance number and dimension using the `BareProblem`
interface. Note that the bare problem *cannot be observed/logged*. 

```{python}
import cocoex

problem = cocoex.BareProblem(
  suite_name="bbob", 
  function=22, 
  dimension=14, 
  instance=42
)
problem(14 * [0])
```

## C Implementation

You can find the C implementation of the problem [here](https://github.com/numbbo/coco-experiment/blob/main/src/f_gallagher.c).
