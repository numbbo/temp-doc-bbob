<div id="text-f13">

$$f_{13}(\mathbf{x}) = z_1^2 + 100\,\sqrt{\sum_{i = 2}^{D} z_i^2} + f_\mathrm{opt}$$

-   $\mathbf{z}= \mathbf{Q}\Lambda^{\!10}\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{x}- \mathbf{x^\mathrm{opt}})$

**Properties:**

As for the Bent Cigar function, a ridge defined as
$\sum_{i=2}^D z_i^2 = 0$ must be followed. The ridge is
non-differentiable and the gradient is constant when the ridge is
approached from any given point. Following the gradient becomes
ineffective close to the ridge where the ridge needs to be followed in
$z_1$-direction to its optimum. The necessary change in "search
behavior" close to the ridge is difficult to diagnose, because the
gradient towards the ridge does not flatten out.\
**Information gained from this function:**
