<div id="text-f12">

$$f_{12}(\mathbf{x}) = z_1^2 + 10^6\sum_{i = 2}^{D} z_i^2 + f_\mathrm{opt}$$

-   $\mathbf{z}= \mathbf{R}\,T^{{0.5}}_\mathrm{asy}(\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{x}- \mathbf{x^\mathrm{opt}}))$

**Properties:**

A ridge defined as $\sum_{i=2}^{D} z_i^2 =0$ needs to be
followed. The ridge is smooth but very narrow. Due to
$T^{{1/2}}_\mathrm{asy}$ the overall shape deviates remarkably from
being quadratic.

-   conditioning is about $10^6$, rotated, unimodal

**Information gained from this function:**

-   Can the search continuously change its search direction?
