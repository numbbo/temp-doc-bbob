The benchmark function definitions in the next section are accompanied
with a number of figures.

1.  a (3-D) surface plot, where $D=2$

2.  a contour plot, where $D=2$

3.  two projected contour plots, where $D=20$. Plotted are,
    starting from the optimum $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{opt}$, first versus
    second variable (left) and first versus fifth variable (right).

4.  sections ($f$ versus $x$) through the global optimum along the first
    variable $x_1$, the second variable $x_2$, and the all-ones vector.
    The sections for different dimensions appear

    1.  in a non-log plot (above), where the maximum $f$-value is
        normalized to one for each single graph.

    2.  in a semi-log plot (middle row)

    3.  in a log-log plot (below) starting close to the global optimum
        along $x
        _1$, $-x_1$, $x_2$, $-x_2$, $\mathbf{1}$,
        and $-\mathbf{1}$.
